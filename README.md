# ISA-Tab Templates Repository

This repository contains ISA-Tab templates for general and lipidomics-specific studies. These templates are designed to guide researchers in organizing metadata for experiments in a standardized format.

## Folder Structure
- **General/**: Templates for generic ISA-Tab use.
- **Lipidomics/**: Templates with additional fields specific to lipidomics.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the appropriate folder (`General/` or `Lipidomics/`).
2. Download the `Investigation.txt`, `Study.txt`, and `Assay.txt` files.
3. Fill out the templates with your study's data, following the examples provided.

## Template Details
### General Templates
- **Investigation.txt**: A basic investigation file structure.
- **Study.txt**: A basic study file structure.
- **Assay.txt**: A basic assay file structure.

### Lipidomics Templates
- **Investigation.txt**: Tailored for lipidomics studies.
- **Study.txt**: Includes lipidomics-specific design descriptors.
- **Assay.txt**: Pre-filled with lipidomics measurement and technology types.
