Study Title	Macrophage ATP citrate lyase deficiency stabilizes atherosclerotic plaques
Study Description	Macrophages represent a major immune cell population in atherosclerotic plaques and play central role in the progression of this lipid-driven chronic inflammatory disease. Targeting immunometabolism is proposed as a strategy to revert aberrant macrophage activation to improve disease outcome. Here, we show ATP citrate lyase (Acly) to be activated in inflammatory macrophages and human atherosclerotic plaques. We demonstrate that myeloid Acly deficiency induces a stable plaque phenotype characterized by increased collagen deposition and fibrous cap thickness, along with a smaller necrotic core. In-depth functional, lipidomic, and transcriptional characterization indicate deregulated fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis and reduced liver X receptor activation within the macrophages in vitro. This results in macrophages that are more prone to undergo apoptosis, whilst maintaining their capacity to phagocytose apoptotic cells. Together, our results indicate that targeting macrophage metabolism improves atherosclerosis outcome and we reveal Acly as a promising therapeutic target to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques.

Study Protocol Description	<p>C57Bl/6J mice with loxP sites flanking exon 9 of the Acly gene (Aclyfl/fl)20 were crossed with Lyz2-Cre transgenic mice to generate mice with a myeloid-specific deletion of Acly (AclyM-KO). Ldlr−/− mice on a C57BL/6 background were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. All mice were maintained in an animal facility at an ambient temperature of 20–24 °C with 40–70% relative humidity under a 12:12 h light–dark cycle. All mouse experiments were conducted after approval by the Committee for Animal Welfare (University of Amsterdam and VU university Amsterdam).</p><p><br></p><p>Bone marrow cells were extracted by flushing femurs and tibias of control and AclyM-KO mice. Cells were seeded and differentiated to macrophages in complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 containing 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 15% L929-conditioned (LCM) medium for 7 days. BMDMs (5 x 10E^6 cells/well) in 24 well plates were left unstimulated or stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS (Sigma) or 20 ng/ml IL-4 (Peprotech) for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were washed 3x with 0.9% NaCl. Metabolism was quenched by adding 1 ml ice-cold methanol/water containing a internal standard mixture (1/1; v/v). D3-aspartic acid, D3-serine, D5-glutamine, D3-glutamate, 13C3-pyruvate, 13C6-isoleucine, 13C6-glucose, 13C6-fructose-1,6-biphosphate, 13C6-glucose-6-phosphate, adenosine-15N5-monophosphate and guanosine-15N5-monophosphate (5 µM) served as internal standards.</p>	<p>1 ml of chloroform was added, vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Approximately 800 ml of the 'polar' top layer was transferred to a 1.5 ml tube, dried in a vacuum concentrator and dissolved in 100 ml methanol/water (6/4; v/v).</p>	<p>Analysis was done using a Thermo Scientific (U)HPLC system coupled to a Thermo Q Exactive (Plus) Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Waltman) with a Merck SeQuant ZIC-cHILIC column PEEK 100 Å (3 µm, 2.1 mm x 150 mm). The mobile phase composed of (A) 9/1 acetonitrile/water with 5 mM ammonium acetate; pH 6.8 and (B) 1/9 acetonitrile/water with 5 mM ammonium acetate; pH 6.8, respectively. The LC program started with 100% (A) hold 0-3 min; ramping 3-24 min to 20% (A); hold from 24-27 min at 20% (A); ramping from 27-28 min to 100% (A); and re-equilibrate from 28-35 min with 100% (A), flow rate was 0.250 ml/min.</p>	<p>The MS data were acquired with a Thermo Q Exactive (Plus) Orbitrap instrument in full scan, negative ionization mode with a mass resolution of 140,000<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Baardman J, Verberk SGS, Prange KHM, van Weeghel M, van der Velden S, Ryan DG, Wüst RCI, Neele AE, Speijer D, Denis SW, Witte ME, Houtkooper RH, O'neill LA, Knatko EV, Dinkova-Kostova AT, Lutgens E, de Winther MPJ, Van den Bossche J.

The peak areas were normalized to their corresponding internal standard and protein. After identification and normalization statistical analyses were performed in the programming language R using <strong>ggplot2</strong>, <strong>ropls</strong>, and <strong>mixOmics</strong> packages.</p>
